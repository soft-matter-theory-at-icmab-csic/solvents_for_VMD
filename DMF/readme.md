# DMF solvent files

Files for solvating a system with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent using VMD.

We include here the coordinates (pdb), structure (psf) and topology (top) files.

To be used with VMD solvate plugin as nonstandard solvent you need the following information:

* A key selection which will occur once in each solvent residue: name N

* The side length of the box (taken from the equilibration's periodic cell): 19.9318459482

We also include the CHARMM CGenFF force field files for performing MD simulations with NAMD (FF update July 22)
